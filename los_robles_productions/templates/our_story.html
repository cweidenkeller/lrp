   <p class="text-center">Your shields were failing, sir. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. You enjoyed that. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? Well, that's certainly good to know. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. and attack the Romulans. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. What? We're not at all alike! Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. We have a saboteur aboard. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. They were just sucked into space. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Not if I weaken first. Talk about going nowhere fast. This should be interesting. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Ensign Babyface! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." The unexpected is our normal routine. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers.</p>
