   <p>I am your worst nightmare! and attack the Romulans. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. What? We're not at all alike! Talk about going nowhere fast. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. I'll alert the crew. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. Sorry, Data. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! Shields up! Rrrrred alert! I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. I'll be sure to note that in my log. Not if I weaken first. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Besides, you look good in a dress. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. You enjoyed that. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise."</p>
